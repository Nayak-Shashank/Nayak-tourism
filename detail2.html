  <h1>User Review: SmartWatch X200</h1>
  <p><strong>Reviewer:</strong> Alex Johnson</p>
  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★★☆</p>
  <p><strong>Review:</strong> I've been using the X200 for a month. The battery is excellent, and the GPS is accurate. The display is a bit dim outdoors, but overall it's a great buy.</p>
